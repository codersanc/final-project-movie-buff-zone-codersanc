# Welcome to The Movie Buff Zone!

Hi! This is '**The Movie Buff Zone**' (Or MBZ for short), a website that helps you find and compare movies online. This website is responsive! You can use it on your cellphones and tablets too.

This is a class project for **LIS-637-01** at **Pratt Institute**

This website uses the tmdb.org api to fetch movie data. More information on the api can be found at - https://developers.themoviedb.org/3

For the concept of comparison, the following research was conducted to obtain a list of popular comparison factors - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cuX0KhPnIX_QlDf4o1i07URiIvictFym
