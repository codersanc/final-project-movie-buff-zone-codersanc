# Welcome to The Movie Buff Zone!

Hi! This is a prototype of the upcoming '**The Movie Buff Zone**' website (Or MBZ for short).

This is a class project for **LIS-637-01** at **Pratt Institute**

The data seen in this prototype is completely hardcoded for testing purpose. Kindly wait for the official release to see this website in full-fledged action!

## Where?

Please access the prototype at the following link - 
http://mysite.pratt.edu/~skumar6/MBZ/

## How?

To use the prototype, the following **3 tasks** can be performed -
1. Search for a movie title
2. View the details of a movie title from the search results page
3. Return to the search results page and add 2 movies for comparison

### Task 1: Search for a movie title

Note: In this prototype, the data is canned, so please only search using the keyword 'Speed'

Steps -
1. Open MBZ Homepage - http://mysite.pratt.edu/~skumar6/MBZ/
2. Click on the **search bar**
3. Enter text '**speed**' into the **search bar**
4. Click '**Search**' or hit **Enter** 

### Task 2: View the details of a movie title from the search results page

Note: In this prototype, the data is canned, so please only view details of the movie 'Speed'

Steps -
1. From the **search results page** (landed from task 1), scroll down to locate the movie '**Speed**'
2. In the search result card for the movie '**Speed**', locate the blue button labeled '**Details**'
3. Click the '**Details**' button for the movie '**Speed**' 

### Task 3: Return to the search results page and add 2 movies for comparison

Note: In this prototype, the data is canned, so please only add movies 'Speed' and 'Speed Racer' for comparison

Steps -
1. From the **details page** (landed from task 2), either use the **breadcrumbs** to go back to the '**Search results**' page, or use the browser **back button**.
2. Once on the '**Search Results**' page, scroll down and locate movies '**Speed**' and '**Speed Racer**'
3. Locate the '**Compare**' button within each of these movies' cards and click them both one by one in any order
4. You will find a small **black bar** at the bottom of the screen where both the titles '**Speed**' and '**Speed racer**' will be added. 
5. Locate the blue '**Compare**' button in the **black bar** and click on it

## However
Kindly note that this is **just a prototype**. Therefore, some features might **not** work at the moment. The data is entirely **canned / hardcoded** for now only for **testing purpose**.

List of things **not** working - 
1. Validation of the Search Field (Homepage)
2. Filters on the Search Results (Search Results page)
3. Cookie based retention of the items added for comparing
