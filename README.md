# Welcome to The Movie Buff Zone!

Hi! This is '**The Movie Buff Zone**' website (Or MBZ for short).

This is a class project for **LIS-637-01** at **Pratt Institute**

This website uses the tmdb.org api to fetch movie data. More information on the api can be found at - https://developers.themoviedb.org/3

## Where?

Please access the website at the following link - 
http://mysite.pratt.edu/~skumar6/MBZ/

## How?

To use the website, the following **4 tasks** can be performed -
1. Search for a movie title
2. Filter the search results by year
3. View the details of a movie title from the search results page
4. Return to the search results page and add 2 movies for comparison
