# Welcome to The Movie Buff Zone!

Hi! This is '**The Movie Buff Zone**' (Or MBZ for short), a website that helps you find and compare movies online. This website is responsive! You can use it on your cellphones and tablets too.

This is a class project for **LIS-637-01** at **Pratt Institute**

This website uses the tmdb.org api to fetch movie data. More information on the api can be found at - https://developers.themoviedb.org/3

For the concept of comparison, the following research was conducted to obtain a list of popular comparison factors - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cuX0KhPnIX_QlDf4o1i07URiIvictFym

## Where?

Please access the website at the following link -

## How?

To use the website, the following **4 tasks** can be performed -
1. Search for a movie title
2. Filter the search results by year
3. View the details of a movie title from the Search Results Page
4. Return to the Search Results Page and add 2 movies for comparison

### Scenario: The weekend is here and Terry is wondering which movie to watch. The weather outside is stormy and Terry is in the mood for some horror flicks which she can enjoy cozily! However, she is totally confused about what to watch

### Task 1: Search for a movie title
**Terry remembers that her friends mentioned a good movie called "Conjuring", so she decides to pull up MBZ and search for Conjuring**

Steps -
1. Open MBZ Homepage - http://mysite.pratt.edu/~skumar6/MBZ/
2. Click on the '**Search Bar**'
3. Enter text '**Conjuring**' into the '**Search Bar**'
4. Click '**Search**' or hit **Enter** 

### Task 2: Filter the search results by year
**Terry wants to watch something new, and she remembers that year 2016 was a great one for movie releases, so she decides to use the year filter**

Steps -
1. From the '**Search Results Page**'' (landed from task 1), locate the button '**Filters**'
2. In the newly displayed '**Year Filter Field**, click and insert the text - '**2016**'
3. Click the '**Check**' button to apply the filter

### Task 3: View the details of a movie title from the Search Results Page
**Terry finds The Conjuring 2, and decides to check its details to see if she can watch it without the prequel**

Steps -
1. From the filtered '**Search Results Page**' (obtained from task 2), locate the movie '**The Conjuring 2**'
2. In the search result card for the movie '**The Conjuring 2**', locate the blue button labeled '**Details**'
3. Click the '**Details**' button for the movie '**The Conjuring 2**'
4. You will now land on the '**Details Page**' for '**The Conjuring 2**'. Scroll down on the '**Details Page**' to view '**Top Cast**'

### Task 4: Return to the Search Results Page and add 2 movies for comparison
**Terry feels that The Conjuring 2 would be better to watch after the prequel. So she heads back to the results and removes the filter for '2016' and finds 'The Conjuring' in the unfiltered results. However, she still needs some convincing, so she searches for another title called 'insidious', which her friends had mentioned and decides to compare it with 'The Conjuring' to make a decision**

Steps -
1. From the '**Details Page**' (landed from task 3), use the **breadcrumbs** to go back to the '**Search results**' page.
2. Once on the '**Search Results Page**', click on the year filter field and clear the value. Then click the '**Check**' button.
3. The '**Search Results Page**' will now reload to display the unfiltered results. Locate the movie '**The Conjuring**' and click the '**Compare**' button within it's card to add it for comparison.
4. You will find a small '**Compare Bar**' at the bottom of the screen where the title '**The Conjuring**' will be added. 
5. For the second title, use the '**Search Bar**' above to search for '**Insidious**'.
6. On the '**Search Results Page**', notice that the '**Compare Bar**' still holds the previously added title - '**The Conjuring**'. Locate the movie '**Insidious**' and click '**Compare**' to add it for comparison.
7. Notice that the '**Compare**' button within the '**Compare Bar**' is now active. Click this '**Compare**' button to reach the '**compare movies page**' showing '**The Conjuring**' vs '**Insidious**'.
8. Scroll down to compare details like '**Cast**', '**Description**', '**Release Date**' etc.

**'The Conjuring'** is way better right? Let's watch that!
